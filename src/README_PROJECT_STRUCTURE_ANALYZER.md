- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the console output** for error messages
2. **Verify file formats** match the expected structure
3. **Try with smaller test files** to isolate issues
4. **Check system requirements** and dependencies

## üìà Performance Tips

### For Large Files
- Allow extra time for initial file processing
- Use the caching benefits for multiple view explorations
- Consider analyzing subsets of data for very large files

### For Multiple Analyses
- Keep the application running to benefit from caching
- Use the reset function only when switching to completely different files
- Take advantage of the unified interface to switch between operation modes
