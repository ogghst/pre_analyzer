   - **Solution 2**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
   - **Solution 3**: Try a specific port: `streamlit run scope_of_supply_analyzer.py --server.port 8502`
   - **Solution 4**: Restart your computer to clear port locks

2. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure you're running from the `src` directory
   - Check that all required packages are installed: `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`
   - Verify Python path configuration

3. **File Processing Errors**
   - Verify file format (Excel .xlsx, .xls, .xlsm)
   - Check file structure matches expected format
   - Ensure file is not corrupted or password-protected

4. **Memory Issues with Large Files**
   - Close other applications to free memory
   - Try processing smaller file sections
   - Consider upgrading system memory

5. **Application Won't Start**
   - Check if another Streamlit app is running
   - Kill Python processes: `taskkill /f /im python.exe` (Windows)
   - Try different port: `streamlit run scope_of_supply_analyzer.py --server.port 8502`
