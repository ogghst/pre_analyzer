## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from parsers.unified_parser import parse_quotation_file
from components.analyzers.unified_comparator import UnifiedComparator

# Parse two files
first_quotation = parse_quotation_file("first_file.xlsx")
second_quotation = parse_quotation_file("second_file.xlsx")

# Create comparator
comparator = UnifiedComparator(
    first_quotation=first_quotation,
    second_quotation=second_quotation,
    first_name="First File",
    second_name="Second File"
)

# Display analysis
comparator.display_executive_summary()
comparator.display_data_consistency_check()
comparator.display_wbe_impact_analysis()
```

### Streamlit Integration

```python
import streamlit as st
from components.analyzers.unified_comparator import UnifiedComparator

# File upload
first_file = st.file_uploader("Upload first file", type=['xlsx', 'xls'])
second_file = st.file_uploader("Upload second file", type=['xlsx', 'xls'])

if first_file and second_file:
    # Parse files
    first_quotation = parse_quotation_file(first_file.name)
    second_quotation = parse_quotation_file(second_file.name)
    
    # Create comparator
    comparator = UnifiedComparator(
        first_quotation=first_quotation,
        second_quotation=second_quotation,
        first_name=first_file.name,
        second_name=second_file.name
    )
    
    # Display views
    view = st.selectbox("Select view", comparator.get_comparison_views())
    
    if view == "Executive Summary":
        comparator.display_executive_summary()
    elif view == "Data Consistency Check":
        comparator.display_data_consistency_check()
    # ... other views
```

## Key Features

### NumberColumn Formatting
All numeric columns in tables are formatted using Streamlit's NumberColumn for better readability:
- Currency values: `â‚¬%.2f`
- Percentages: `%.2f%%`
- Integers: `%d`
- Quantities: `%.2f`

### Export Functionality
- CSV export for detailed analysis
- Filtered results export
- Missing items export
- Issues export

### Interactive Filtering
- Filter by comparison status
- Filter by WBE
- Sort by various criteria
- Real-time filtering

### Visual Analytics
- Pie charts for comparison results
- Bar charts for value comparisons
- Scatter plots for margin analysis
- Color-coded visualizations

## Comparison Logic

### Item Matching
- Items are matched by their unique codes
- Automatic detection of missing items
- Value comparison with tolerance for rounding differences

### Financial Analysis
- Total value calculations
- Percentage difference analysis
- Margin impact assessment
- Cost structure comparison

### WBE Impact
- Work Breakdown Element analysis
- Items added, removed, and modified
- Financial impact on each WBE
- Margin percentage changes

## Error Handling

The comparator includes robust error handling:
- Safe float conversion for numeric values
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Fallback values for missing fields

## Performance

- Efficient item mapping for fast lookups
- Optimized data structures
- Minimal memory usage
- Fast comparison algorithms

## Example Output

### Executive Summary
```
ðŸ“Š Unified Quotation Comparison - Executive Summary

Data Consistency: 45/67 (67.2% match)
Items Missing in Second: 12 (Items to add)
Items with Differences: 10 (Items to review)
WBEs Affected: 3 out of 8 total

ðŸ’° Financial Impact Summary
First File Total: â‚¬125,000.00
Second File Total: â‚¬118,500.00
Difference: â‚¬6,500.00 (+5.5%)
